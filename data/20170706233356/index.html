There will be only one content process for instance initially with e10s enabled in the Firefox browser.</p><p>This means that websites will share that process for their data, which is different to how browsers that are based on Chromium handle this as they launch a new process for every page open in the browser and also for plugins.</p><h2>Changing Firefox's multi-process content processes</h2><p>Firefox would not be Firefox if there would not be an option to play around with different content process values.</p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-119009" src="firefox-content-processes.jpg" alt="firefox content processes" srcset="firefox-content-processes.jpg 848w, firefox-content-processes-660x429.jpg 660w, firefox-content-processes-768x499.jpg 768w, firefox-content-processes-100x65.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 848px) 100vw, 848px" width="848" height="551"></p><p>While Firefox will ship with one content process initially, nothing is keeping users from increasing that limit to use more than one content process.</p><p>Each content process is listed as Plugin Container for "Firefox version" in the operating system's task manager. The file name is listed as plugin-container.exe on Windows.</p><p>Firefox runs as many content processes as you see listed there, provided that multi-process use is enabled in the browser.</p><p><strong>dom.ipc.processCount</strong></p><p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-119010" src="dom.ipc_.processCount.jpg" alt="dom.ipc.processCount" srcset="dom.ipc_.processCount.jpg 936w, dom.ipc_.processCount-660x248.jpg 660w, dom.ipc_.processCount-768x289.jpg 768w, dom.ipc_.processCount-100x38.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 936px) 100vw, 936px" width="936" height="352"></p><p>It is rather easy to change the number of content processes.

And they keep pushing it back. The reason I ditched FF in 2014 and most of 2015 was for 2 main reasons:</p><p>1- Website like amazon would bring firefox to it's knees while browsing was ultra-smooth on chrome. I think e10s will solve this one.<br> 2- Once it reached about 900Mb of ram usage, firefox becomes unresponsive. Since I do alot of maintenance on joomla websites , I reach that limit quickly.(joomla admin interface eat up ram fast it seems) Again, chrome was running smoothly when FF wasn't anymore. Strangely, the linux version of FF doesn't have this problem, but my main computer runs windows, so... (64 bits version of FF didn't solve this problem on windows either)</p><p>I came back to FF at the end of 2015 because I just felt like chrome was way too invasive with all the google service spying you. So back to FF, with it's problem that are still there after 18 months. Well, back until vivaldi becomes a viable alternative, and I'm pretty sure that will be before e10s ever arrive.(there is only one tiny little thing that isn't working properly yet in vivaldi. Very hopeful it wil be fixed soon as they continue to fix bugs very fast, it's insane!)</p><div class="reply"> <a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-3817312" aria-label="Reply to Kin" data-wpel-link="internal">Reply</a></div></div></div><ul class="children"><li class="comment odd alt depth-2"> <a name="comment-3817326" data-wpel-link="internal"></a><div id="li-comment-3817326" class="comment-container"><div class="avatar"></div><div class="comment-head"> <span class="name">Decent60</span> <span class="date">February 15, 2016 at 8:10 pm</span> <span class="perma"><a href="#comment-3817326" title="Direct link to this comment" data-wpel-link="internal">#</a></span> <span class="edit"></span></div><div class="comment-entry" id="comment-3817326"><p>For both of your problems, I agree with that Sören Hentzschel said: There is something wrong with your computer.</p><p>I run many versions of Firefox (Cyberfox, Waterfox, Firefox 64-bit, Palemoon), I've never encountered Amazon "bring it to it's knees" with any of them. I shop and browse on there constantly. I play YouTube videos while looking at other content, mostly my RAM usage is at around 1GB (I get distracted easily and have a crapload of tabs open lol) per browser.</p><p>Vivaldi does look promising tho.

I regularly use amazon (.com, .de, .fr, .ca, .jp, .uk ). My computer runs at a nice 45-50 degrees - loading an amazon site (vamilla FF with no extensions), and it easily jumps to 65 dgerees, working as hard as heck in the background (another site is following the LPGA live scores, even on Chrome). Maybe its poor JS code. Because basically every other site out there does not do this (mind you I block all XSS JS by default).</p><p>- If I allow just amazon.com's scripts, the temp quickly jumped from 47 to 50 (and then back down)<br> - If I then also allow images-amazon.com scripts it went from 47 to 52 and then slowly down to 47<br> - If I then allow ssl-images-amazon.com scripts it went from 47 to 54 and then settled at 49</p><p>it just gets exponentially worse the more we let through - I'm still blocking a lot of stuff here, including amazon frames, amazon-adsystem, amazonaws, static.amazon, fls-na.amazon, cloudfront-labs.amazonaws, amazonmusiclocal.com etc. Allowing these through just triggers more and more scripts. The site is an absolute resource hog. Imagine how much shit is going on to make the CPU temp jump to 65 and higher.</p><p>So I totally understand point 1. Sites like amazon would bring FF to it's knees.</p><div class="reply"> <a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-3817405" aria-label="Reply to Pants" data-wpel-link="internal">Reply</a></div></div></div><ul class="children"><li class="comment odd alt depth-3"> <a name="comment-3818020" data-wpel-link="internal"></a><div id="li-comment-3818020" class="comment-container"><div class="avatar"></div><div class="comment-head"> <span class="name">Jason</span> <span class="date">February 16, 2016 at 4:04 pm</span> <span class="perma"><a href="#comment-3818020" title="Direct link to this comment" data-wpel-link="internal">#</a></span> <span class="edit"></span></div><div class="comment-entry" id="comment-3818020"><p>@Pants:</p><p>How to spot a computer nerd: See if he (or she?) measures website loading problems in degrees Celsius.</p><p>LOL, well done. :) You remind me of... me.</p><div class="reply"></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even depth-3"> <a name="comment-3818317" data-wpel-link="internal"></a><div id="li-comment-3818317" class="comment-container"><div class="avatar"></div><div class="comment-head"> <span class="name">Pants</span> <span class="date">February 17, 2016 at 5:52 pm</span> <span class="perma"><a href="#comment-3818317" title="Direct link to this comment" data-wpel-link="internal">#</a></span> <span class="edit"></span></div><div class="comment-entry" id="comment-3818317"><p>@Jason .... what is with you guys and gals.

Most valuable : after a long session &amp; high RAM usage it frees quite a lot otherwise "stuck" RAM (above example : 1.5GB -&gt; Exit 'Google Street View' -&gt; Clean cache (RAM only here) -&gt; 900MB -&gt; "Minimize memory usage" -&gt; 512MB used RAM, when Firefox here (64-BIT) and 65 add-ons starts at ~350MB) ... so it's a valuable operation.</p><p>But this has nothing to do with Electrolysis.</p><div class="reply"></div></div></div></li><li class="comment odd alt depth-3"> <a name="comment-3818224" data-wpel-link="internal"></a><div id="li-comment-3818224" class="comment-container"><div class="avatar"></div><div class="comment-head"> <span class="name">Appster</span> <span class="date">February 17, 2016 at 10:34 am</span> <span class="perma"><a href="#comment-3818224" title="Direct link to this comment" data-wpel-link="internal">#</a></span> <span class="edit"></span></div><div class="comment-entry" id="comment-3818224"><p>@gh:</p><p>It makes no sense to discuss a problem with Sören Hentzschel.

Aris, a well-known developer, who is far more important than you are, doubts that WebExtensions will offer the same API set as XUL-based extensions. You can't accept that and try to whitewash the future catastrophe. FANBOY! Sorry, you should just accept the hard truth, Ex-Mozilla-Representative Hentzschel.<br> "1. It is a fact that there are not a lot of such support requests in the German speaking support and you know that I know that because I am part of the support, you are not."<br> &gt; And how does that affect the problem of gh? This particular user has a problem which needs to be solved. What happens in the support forum probably is of no concern to him. Let me add that I don't envy your position in the support forum as you will have thousands of support requests in the immediate future. E10S and WebExtensions will most likely cause those...<br> "2.

Even if the others were fanboys - how would that extenuate your arrogance and ignorance? Wow, that makes sense.

Of course you can tell me you aren't, and I would do so too if I was you (luckily I am not), but that won't change the facts. Unless you prove otherwise I will continue to call you this way, because that is what I see with my own eyes.

You are a fanboy without manners, calling people liars... But I didn't compare both of you as private persons but as developers. Aris saved my ass and that of many others when Mozilla destroyed the Firefox interface with Australis which you have defended. His CTR extension is very complex and certainly more complex than your Add-Ons. He has more users, too. It is therefore completely reasonable to call him more important than you. Based on your extensions he is likely also a better developer. Yet you are arrogant and try to explain WebExtensions to him.

I don't hold my opinion in such a high esteem, believe me. My opinion is only my opinion. However, I don't know why a random fanboy always has to criticize and flame around so that I have to answer.<br> "As everyone can see you just use each opportunity to offense me."<br> &gt; It gets boring... It was the truth about you. An offense is something entirely different. If you can't live with the truth go away and cry.<br> "I don't know your problem and I am not interesting to knowing your problem."<br> &gt; And this is okay. I know what I have to know about you. I know that you are a fanboy and this enrages me. If you want to call this one a problem then you can also guess the cause of it.<br> "PLEASE, just ignore my comments and it's a better world for everyone!"<br> &gt; Honestly, I try to ignore them.

The amazon thingy happens on the 3 Windows computers use regularly. All of them went through multiple hardware upgrades, OS reinstall and it happened on Windows 7 and now 10. On fresh installation as much as older running OS. I do nothing special on amazon, I simply browse and buy like everyone else. Even scrolling the front page on the initial load, it already start to stutter, and product pages will eventually take alot more time to display completely, with scrolling being a nightmare, it will even lock up eventually. Since chrome, opera and vivaldi don't have that problem, I always suspected it was because they separates stuff in many process. I never use IE, so I don't know about that one.</p><p>Don't think I haven't searched the web for solutions over the years. I found many report of the same, but no solution(beside the usual, start with add-ons disabled, etc. Didn't help)</p><p>Number 2 happens 100% of the time when I do admin work on joomla websites. I usually open about 10-12 tabs with the joomla admin interface in each, and when it get close to a Gb of RAM used, FF will start to become unresponsive, locking up for 2-3 seconds at a time. Even windows task manager will report it as not responding. Again, this has happened for 2-3 years, on fresh OS install as much as on older. Maybe it's the javascript, as someone mentionned, no idea.</p><p>Btw, I don't expect everyone to have those probs, heck, half the problems people seem to have with FF, I didn't have. Yet, I don't go around saying they don't exist because of that, I'm not a FF dev.(little free jab at them. I remember some bug reports with hundreds of votes that get closed because the dev thinks it must be an add-on that cause the problem, and he doesn't have the prob so he close the bug, or about a missing feature that he think should be added through an add-on, and as such should not be added in the core(and yes, that's the same dev that tells you to remove add-ons... gotta love the irony.)</p><div class="reply"> <a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-3817401" aria-label="Reply to Kin" data-wpel-link="internal">Reply</a></div></div></div><ul class="children"><li class="comment even depth-2"> <a name="comment-3817420" data-wpel-link="internal"></a><div id="li-comment-3817420" class="comment-container"><div class="avatar"></div><div class="comment-head"> <span class="name">Pants</span> <span class="date">February 16, 2016 at 2:54 am</span> <span class="perma"><a href="#comment-3817420" title="Direct link to this comment" data-wpel-link="internal">#</a></span> <span class="edit"></span></div><div class="comment-entry" id="comment-3817420"><p>Totally agree with you (see my comment above). I know you said starting with all addons disabled made no change, but one of the first things I would suggest (no doubt you did this already), is make sure that your Antivirus has "web" protection turned off - from the AV interface options, not just any "plugin" that FF sees. AV web protection is shit, it that interfers with all your web traffic, it is especially bad when it plays MiTM with your HTTPS traffic. Your browsers have built in safe-browsing protection, they have internal sandboxes, and you can also protect your PC in many other ways. AV is about 30th (and last) on a list of things to protect your computer - so turn off the WEB protection part, at least for testing purposes.</p><p>Also, I would recommend you try uMatrix. Go grab a portable FF version from <a href="http://www.portableaps.com/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">http://www.portableaps.com</a>. Go to plugins and make sure any AV and other crap is disabled if it's there). Load amazon, bookmark it, log in (make sure to allow cookies etc) so its a real world scenario for you. Browse around. This is your control test. If we assume you still have issues, then install uMatrix. Go to amazon, pop up the uMatrix panel and play. It's a bit hard to explain how to use uMatrix. The very top left of the grid, when you click on it, allows you to change the "scope" of what you are doing. At amazon.com I have three items in the top left corner, they are *, amazon.com, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com</a>. Make sure you select the "amazon.com one". You can click the top (to go green) or bottom (to go red) of a cell to change behavior, you click it again to toggle the setting it on/off. You can click an entire row or column. And then you can refresh the page to see changes, and you can click the padlock or erasure to save the changes permanently. Just have a play.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki/Very-bare-walkthrough-for-first-time-users" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://github.com/gorhill/uMatrix/wiki/Very-bare-walkthrough-for-first-time-users</a></p><p>It's really not that hard to work out how to use. The default rules (from the * scope) apply, then the row/column rules (for the domain, eg amazon.com) over-ride those, and then lastly individual cell rules (for the domain) over-ride those. If a cell is pale red or pale green, it's just abiding by the rules for the column/row etc. If it's dark red or dark green, then it's set in stone and no row/column rule or default rule will change it.</p><p>You can also go to the uMatrix internal pages and import/export, add/edit rules.

Without e10s there is only one process for both, content and chrome. Additionally e10s is a requirement for sandboxing, so that's another improvement brought by e10s, even with only one content process.</p><p>@Neal:</p><p>&gt; You would better off just using Firefox ESR.</p><p>Using Firefox ESR means only to get all the changes at a later date. Firefox ESR 45 won't have e10s enabled so Firefox 45 won't have e10s enabled, too. But there will be a Firefox ESR 52 and Firefox ESR 52 will be based on Firefox 52. So if Firefox 52 won't have an option to disable e10s then also Firefox ESR 52 won't have this option. I don't think that already a plan exists when the option will be removed, but it does not make sense to keep the option forever, that would be a large maintenance burden. And because of that it would make a lot of sense to remove the option with Firefox 52 at the latest, otherwise Mozilla has to maintain the non-e10s code for another year. But it will depend on the progresses in the next months when the option can be removed.</p><div class="reply"> <a rel="nofollow" class="comment-reply-link" href="#comment-3818469" aria-label="Reply to Sören Hentzschel" data-wpel-link="internal">Reply</a></div></div></div><ul class="children"><li class="comment odd alt depth-3"> <a name="comment-3818557" data-wpel-link="internal"></a><div id="li-comment-3818557" class="comment-container"><div class="avatar"></div><div class="comment-head"> <span class="name">Jeff Taylor</span> <span class="date">February 18, 2016 at 4:30 pm</span> <span class="perma"><a href="#comment-3818557" title="Direct link to this comment" data-wpel-link="internal">#</a></span> <span class="edit"></span></div><div class="comment-entry" id="comment-3818557"><p>Thanks, Sören.</p><p>I can see now that separating the chrome and content processes would have benefits, possibly worth the 10 - 20% extra memory consumption anticipated.

I think I know as much as I need to know at this point.</p><p>Unfortunately, I come away feeling like this, like the Australis "improvements," is a losing proposition for me, although I represent a super-small minority of users.</p><p>For those of us who don't want to, or can't afford to, get a new computer, the 3 GB effective RAM limit for 32-bit Windows means that a large FF memory footprint impacts all operations on the system. Therefore, even the anticipated best-case expectation for increased memory means trouble for me.</p><p>That won't be the case for most users, with 64-bit Windows, lots of memory, and very fast processors. FF has to design with their base, and for the base that will exist in the future--and I'm not it.</p><p>The only reason FF is my browser of choice is the tab management features offered by TabMixPlus, particularly displaying open tabs in multiple rows. In turn, that's important because I usually have hundreds of tabs open at once when doing research. FF becomes slow to load at that point, but that's not a problem because I simply launch it at the start of the day, and walk away to fix breakfast while everything loads.</p><p>I've used Sandboxie for years, so that sandboxing feature will bring nothing to me.</p><p>The probable stability improvements seem like an answer to a question that is seldom asked. It's hard to remember when the contents of a tab have caused FF to crash for me.</p><p>Finally, any gains in "responsiveness" seem like they will be, at best, likely to be measurable, but not noticeable. Even with my system, the basic operation of opening a page is now totally dependent on the speed of my internet connection--so long as I run an ad-blocker and Flash blocker. The only pages that are currently slow to load are those using lots of those elements.</p><p>However, although I can't test this hypothesis on my own machine, when I've used other people's computers, which had 6 - 8 GB of RAM, and a faster processor, it seemed like I'd hardly ever notice lag when I opened any page, even without any blocking add-ons installed.</p><p>At any rate, I'll stay with ESR as long as possible, and see what the situation is like when those builds begin to require operating with e10s. My hope is that, at that point, Pale Moon or other forks will continue to offer today's functionality to those of us for whom the "latest and greatest" is often the "latest and worse."</p><p>Thanks again.</p><div class="reply"></div></div></div></li></ul></li></ul></li><li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1"> <a name="comment-3953140" data-wpel-link="internal"></a><div id="li-comment-3953140" class="comment-container"><div class="avatar"></div><div class="comment-head"> <span class="name">Tomi Häsä</span> <span class="date">August 8, 2016 at 1:35 pm</span> <span class="perma"><a href="#comment-3953140" title="Direct link to this comment" data-wpel-link="internal">#</a></span> <span class="edit"></span></div><div class="comment-entry" id="comment-3953140"><p>Has anyone tested the best number for the setting on their computer?
