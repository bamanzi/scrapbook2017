I can sort by newest or updated for instance, something that cannot be done on Google's Chrome Web Store.</p><p>Mozilla lists featured add-ons, most popular add-ons, as well as up and coming extensions on the front page.</p><p>All add-on types that are supported by Firefox are highlighted on Firefox AMO. This includes WebExtensions and classic add-ons. The repository even lists add-ons that are no longer compatible with recent versions of the Firefox browser (due to changes to the add-ons system).</p><p>With <a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2016/11/24/firefox-will-only-support-web-extensions-by-the-end-of-2017/" data-wpel-link="internal">Mozilla's decision to support only WebExtensions in Firefox 57</a> comes an issue that Mozilla has not addressed yet: most add-ons on AMO are not WebExtensions, but are still highlighted to users when they open the repository.</p><p>Lets take a look at featured, most popular and top rated, and the ratio of legacy add-ons and WebExtensions:</p><ul><li><strong>Featured Add-ons</strong>: Mozilla lists 108 featured add-ons on Firefox AMO right now. Of those 108 add-ons, 80 are legacy add-ons and 28 are compatible with Firefox 57.</li><li><strong>Most Popular Add-ons</strong>: The first five pages of the most popular add-ons on Firefox AMO list 100 add-ons. Of those 100 add-ons, 88 are legacy add-ons and 12 WebExtensions.</li><li><strong>Top Rated Add-ons</strong>: The first five pages of the top rated add-ons on Mozilla AMO list 100 add-ons. Of those 100 add-ons, 88 are legacy extensions and 12 WebExtensions.</li></ul><p>Please note that this reflects the current status of the add-ons. Some add-ons, like NoScript for instance, will be released as WebExtensions before Mozilla makes the cut in Firefox 57.</p><div style="clear: both; margin-top: 0em; margin-bottom: 1em;"><a href="https://www.ghacks.net/2016/10/30/firefox-ublock-origin-webextension-released/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" class="u0a99dd6b795e17f49f64ddc929be7abd" data-wpel-link="internal"><style>

I'm not suggesting that Mozilla removes all legacy add-ons on AMO, but the organization should consider hiding those on the main entry pages.</p><p>The reasons why add-ons should not be removed are:</p><ul><li>They are still supported right now, and will be after the release of Firefox 57 (for instance in ESR or third-party Firefox based browsers like Pale Moon).</li><li>Add-ons may be ported by their developers so that they are offered as WebExtensions.</li></ul><p>Firefox users, especially new ones, who visit the AMO site may install legacy add-ons in the browser. Those will work just fine for the next release cycles, but won't anymore with the release of Firefox 57.</p><p>Mozilla should, at the very least, add a disclaimer or notification to the legacy add-on installation process that highlights the fact.</p><p>While tech savvy Firefox users know all about the change already, the majority of Firefox users probably does not.</p><p><strong>Now You</strong>: What's your take on this?</p><div id="snippet-box" style="background: rgb(245, 245, 245) none repeat scroll 0% 0%;

All webextensions are marked as compatible with Firefox 57+.<br> 4. If you only want to see WebExtensions you can use the "firefox57" filter.<br> 5. There are many add-ons which are still legacy add-ons but will become WebExtensions. Hiding these add-ons means that these add-ons will not be used only because there are not a WebExtension *now*. That's not a requirement. One example is my add-on New Tab Override. I will publish a WebExtension version. In a few months.

For the same reason, many users have not heard of FF 52 ESR and do not know what ESR means.<br> 3. When installing an Add-On, if it is a LEGACY Add-On there is a small orange triangle containing a red "!". Next to it is a clickable link to "permissions". When the "permissions" box opens the following is displayed:<br> "Please note this add-on uses legacy technology, which gives it access to all browser functions and data without requesting your permission."<br> There is NO WARNING that a Legacy Add-On will STOP working in FF 57.<br> 4. Referring back to 1. above, many users will not use the FF 57 filter because of lack of knowledge.<br> 5.

I think the last blow will be when distros drop Firefox and Thunderbird from their default applications in favour of Chromium.

CTR will die when Firefox 57 hits. So the Cyberfox dev chose the last ESR version before that (Firefox 52 ESR) which he will maintain until its EOL. Cyberfox would not be Cyberfox anymore, so he chose to end the project. Waterfox never incorporated any add-on, it just introduced some user-friendly changes (no telemetry, no DRM, no ads, NPAPI plug-ins still working, unsigned extensions still working) which he can likely still keep up in builds based on Firefox 57+. The Cyberfox-Waterfox comparison shows that you have no clue at all.</p><p>&gt; An antique run by a couple of Luddites who think FF (and the web as a whole) should cater to them instead of the other way around. Delusional at best.</p><p>There is very few breakage to be seen when using the Pale moon browser, so you are a bit exaggerating here. However, you are right about their general attitude. Can't argue about that really.</p><p>&gt; Probably the best choice but as you say, it's temporary and won't be around in another year.</p><p>True. This still shows that Mozilla doesn't take businesses seriously though. Introducing big changes mid-cycle is not business-oriented. They should postpone these changes to Firefox 60, so that Firefox 59 ESR can still be used by organizations in preparation for the big changeover.</p><div class="reply"></div></div></div></li><li class="comment even depth-3"> <a name="comment-4213971" data-wpel-link="internal"></a><div id="li-comment-4213971" class="comment-container"><div class="avatar"></div><div class="comment-head"> <span class="name">Jody Thornton</span> <span class="date">June 24, 2017 at 5:04 pm</span> <span class="perma"><a href="#comment-4213971" title="Direct link to this comment" data-wpel-link="internal">#</a></span> <span class="edit"></span></div><div class="comment-entry" id="comment-4213971"><p>@ ww com</p><p>I'm surprised that you don't see any longevity in Waterfox as an option.

But I will prove my point by showing you selected about:config settings jeopardizing privacy:</p><p>- "extensions.getAddons.cache.enabled" is true by default. It sends information about what add-ons you have installed to Mozilla. It is not related to the add-on update process. Why does Mozilla collect such data?<br> - "network.captive-portal-service.enabled" contacts the following website... <a href="http://detectportal.firefox.com/success.txt" rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">http://detectportal.firefox.com/success.txt</a> ...every single time you connect to a new WiFi hotspot, even if your computer handles the WiFi hotspot all by itself already. Why does Firefox need to do this?<br> - "security.family_safety.mode" is set to 2 by default. It will censor content Microsoft wants to be censored via a local man-in-the-middle proxy in Windows 10.<br> - "dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled" is set to true by default. It reports to the website owner every cut/copy/paste you perform on his website. Veeery private...<br> - "dom.battery.enabled" is set to true by default. Websites can access your battery count and related information, e.g. what programs you use. Mozilla allows this by default.<br> - "beacon.enabled" is set to true by default. Website owners are able to receive information from Firefox once you've left the website. Only useful for tracking, and Mozilla allows this by default.</p><p>So please, don't just repeat what others say while not knowing anything about the default settings, which definitely allow for your privacy to be evaded. Guess what? I've disabled all of them and haven't seen any breakage.</p><p>Customisability? Source? Most add-on which could massively customize the interface will be gone when Firefox 57 hits. I want you to give me reasons to use Firefox 57 and beyond, and this is definitely not one.</p><p>Next Gen performance? You really believe that? When will it hit? In 20 years?

Now you will certainly come up with the typical "You got Firefox for free, so you have no right to complain!" bullshit argument. Guess what? I have paid with my data and Mozilla still relies on significant user numbers if they want website maintainers to support them!

Mozilla does not offer a privacy-oriented product by default and assumes that the majority of the userbase does not have the skills/means to change those settings.

And even then the WebExtensions that were compatible with Firefox 56 will run in Waterfox 56, so the users will not be left with no add-ons exactly. In regards to the XUL add-ons you are right though.</p><p>&gt; Will Waterfox produce their own webpages to make up for that?</p><p>I don't know. But - as you have pointed out - the ESR version will not stay forever, and the Waterfox dev has already stated that he will keep producing builds based on corresponding Firefox 57+ versions. It is what it is, a transitional build. Not sure why maintaining own add-on sites would make sense in this context. Nobody knows really.</p><p>&gt; Pale Moon does a lot of stupid things. Are you really surprised? Color me surprised if you are. I won't mind. ;)</p><p>Not surprised at all. The Pale Moon devs also expect companies like Facebook to cater to them. WebExtensions will be capable enough for simple tasks like adblocking, video downloading, HTTPS Everywhere etc. There is no need to force add-on devs to create a XUL/XPCOM add-on which does the same. I would have liked to see them supporting both types of add-ons. Since every major browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera) will support the same or very similar type of extension it will prove disastrous to completely miss out on that. They really expect add-on developers to maintain a separate add-on for them.
